# Megaline_Plan_Selection
Megaline is a mobile carrier trying to develop a model to analyze subscribers' behavior to recommend one of Megaline's newer plans: Smart or Ultra.   Project success will be in developing a model with the highest possible accuracy (0.75) that will pick the right plan.

üì± Recommending the Right Plan with Machine Learning
Helping Megaline Boost Customer Satisfaction and Retention Through Smart ML Choices

When telecom giant Megaline noticed subscribers sticking to legacy plans despite better options available, they asked a crucial question:
‚ÄúCan we use machine learning to recommend our newer, more tailored plans‚ÄîSmart or Ultra‚Äîto the right customers at the right time?‚Äù

As a machine learning engineer, I stepped into this challenge to build a classification model that could reliably predict a customer's ideal plan using behavioral usage data. With a benchmark accuracy target of 75%, the project moved from exploratory data analysis to model comparison and optimization, culminating in a Random Forest model that beat the target with an 81.5% accuracy on the test set.

This project demonstrates end-to-end ML workflow: from data prep and EDA to hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation, and selection based on production readiness‚Äînot just academic performance.

üìå Project Conclusion
This project successfully delivered on Megaline's goal: to identify which of its customers would benefit most from switching to the Ultra mobile plan using behavioral usage data. After conducting thorough data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and testing three classification models‚ÄîLogistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest‚Äîthe Random Forest Classifier emerged as the top performer.

With a test accuracy of 81.5%, this model not only exceeded the project benchmark of 75% but also demonstrated strong generalization, indicating it can perform well on unseen customer data. This outcome suggests a reliable, scalable solution that Megaline can use to drive data-informed plan recommendations, improve customer satisfaction, and reduce churn.

The modeling process also emphasized practical ML development skills, including feature engineering, model validation, hyperparameter tuning, and careful evaluation using train/validation/test splits‚Äîensuring the selected model is production-ready and business-relevant.

Going forward, Megaline can integrate this model into their CRM or user dashboard to make personalized plan suggestions in real time, potentially increasing conversion rates and optimizing plan utilization across their customer base.
